## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your local machine
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) set up and running
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) account for payment integration (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airbnb-clone.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash

   cd server
   npm install
   ```

4. Install client dependencies:

   ```bash

   npm install
   ```

5. Set up environment variables:

   - Create a `.env` file in the server directory and configure your MongoDB connection URI, JWT secret, and Stripe API keys (if using payment integration).

   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key (optional)
   ```
